# `roux-stream`

A streaming API for the Rust Reddit client
[`roux`](https://github.com/halcyonnouveau/roux).

Reddit's API does not provide "firehose"-style streaming of new posts and
comments. Instead, the endpoints for retrieving the latest posts and comments
have to be polled regularly. This crate automates that task and provides streams
for a subreddit's posts (submissions) and comments.


## Documentation

The documentation is available [on `docs.rs`](https://docs.rs/roux-stream) and
contains examples for [streaming submissions](https://docs.rs/roux-stream/latest/roux_stream/fn.stream_submissions.html#example)
and [streaming comments](https://docs.rs/roux-stream/latest/roux_stream/fn.stream_comments.html#example).

An example for streaming both submissions and comments at the same time can be
found in the file [`examples/submissions-and-comments.rs`](https://github.com/torfsen/roux-stream/blob/main/examples/submissions-and-comments.rs).
